# GLOM Implementation

What's the model capability of GLOM?
Minimal implementation of the GLOM architecture in PyTorch, inspired by Hinton's idea described in [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12627.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12627.pdf).

Currently, I'm training some GLOM configurations for different benchmarks.
